I have programmed the assignment in Ruby.
To run the code, 

> rb friends.rb <input word> <filename of words>


1) I have first created a smaller input from all the words using the length of the word as a factor to filter out unnecessary words.
   This is because a 'friend' of a word can only be of length exactly equal to the original word.
2) I have then recursively found of friends of words, by putting them into a queue structure.
3) At the end, I print out the words and the total of the words.
